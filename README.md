[Milestone Project4 - Lazycamp](https://new-lazycamp.herokuapp.com/)

## Project purpose

<hr>

Camping last minute is currently very difficult unless you are a seasoned camper or very familiar with the area, in particular the site, you want to visit.
Existing options discourage last minute bookings by making it difficult, often blocking out the current and next date as booking options, or insist on early arrival times which prohibit last minute decisions for a night away. 

Lazycamp will instantly list available sites on the day, in the county or postal district you search for,  without having to search each individual site details only to find at the end your choice is unavailable. 

The freedom of the open road can be exhilerating. This is currently easy if you use the major hotel booking sites but if you want to camp along the way it is  tricky.

The current market leader has recently (while I have been developing my project over lockdown)  improved dramatically but still requires a considerable investment of time to negotiate the site and book.  Lazycamp focuses on fast find and fast book with instant confirmation. 

Currently 12% of campers do not book ahead, blaming the weather. Checking rain and sunshine is an important consideration for many tent lovers. This is discouraged by the camping and caravanning industry in the UK because allowing users to wait and check the weather makes many business users feel vulnerable. When asked users will always say they would camp more if you could book without the need for so much planning. Lazycamp aims satisfy the user and attract business users who are willing to take late bookings to fill all their empty spots and generate more income. 

This concept has proved itself in all other areas of accommodation booking. Making it easier for users to book when they want is going to benefit users immediately and business users ultimately. 

Lazycamp will also open up the opportunity for microcampsites to spring up near to airports, festivals and seasonal attractions that may not be profitable to run all year round , for example, in Scotland, the number of tourists each summer excedes the number of overnight accommodation. A farm which may have a beautiful view of a lavender field or autumn forest may want to just run for a month. Lazycamp is a next generation, user led, fast campspot booking system, which will promote these microcampsites that would be very difficult to find otherwise.

Lazycamp creates flexibility that does not exist currently and limits the amount of research necessary to find what you a user wants.

In addition to overnight camping and caravanning, Lazycamp will promote camping events for between 15-40 people. The theme of the events will vary from tech free, food or alcohol detox to campfire music, outdoor cooking and holistic fresh air therapies. 
With  crowded indoor gatherings still being actively discouraged this is the perfect time for people to explore wild camping, microcampsites or established campsites for a short break or holiday.

Lazy camp is all about making it easy and attractive for users who do not enjoy extensive research and preplanning. 

This project will roll out in Wales first and Scotland to follow.  The focus being in a smaller area will hopefully attract more hosts and users as searches will generate more options. 

Because the camping season in the UK is so short campsites need to fill their sites to be viable. Lazycamp will fill last minute spots and cancellations.

## User stories

<hr>

* As a user I expect to be able to quickly find the nearest pitch/ campsite or spot where I can safely camp for the night.

* As user I want to clearly see which campspots are available and not be wasting time being presented with fully booked campspots. 
I do not want to waste my time, be frustrated or disappointed.

* As a user, if I have viewed a campsite and it is sold out, I want to see it still featured but now fully booked. This will stop me being confused if the spot has disappeared from all views and I may wonder if I saw it on a different website. 

* As a user I may have needs or preferences that I want to be able to prioritise in a search for example, pets, car space, public transport, shower, electricity, local amenities.

* As I user I want to know if the campsite is quiet, lively, family oriented, waterside, farm, wood, mountain etc.

* As I user I want to know the price I will need to pay.

* I may want to prepay so that I can arrive when I want and know my place is secured.

* As a user I want to be able to access the pitch normal hours and spontaneously.

* As a user I want to find pitches that offer late arrival or late checkout depending on my preference. 

* As I user I want to ensure that the campsite participation is current and that I will have access and knowledge of where to go exactly.

* I do not want to be given outdated event or pitch information. 

* I want to know a fixed basic price and what will cost me extra. Do I need Â£1 coins for on site facilities e.g showers, lockers or gaming. 

* As I user I may want to try camping for the first time with tips and ideas and to make my experience as comfortable as possible.

* As a user I may need local information e.g. scottish midges, noisy frogs, local early cockerel or noisy dawn chorus, farm animal smells etc. I want to know the bad points as well as the good so I know what to expect, have the option to prepare so that I can relax and enjoy myself.

* As a user I would like a profile of previous bookings and to find them easily. 

* I would like to a very simple login process. I would like password reset. 

* As a user enjoy chat to help get ideas or make plans? 

* I want my payment to be made easily and securely. I want email Acknowledgements

* I would like messages appear when I submit, enquire or book that tewll me I have been successful. 

* As  a user I would like email confirmation with all the information I will need to find and access the camp spot. 

* If I am camping my phone may not be charged and I am unlikely to have been able to print my booking so I would like my email address and name to be evidence enough to the business user.

* I want flexibility and maybe a credit offer if I can not make my booking. 

* As a user I would like to know what is closest to my ideal spot if there are no ideal spots. for example i have 2 children and a dog so it must be a child and pet friendly site but I may be willing to park a distance away from the pitch or do without electric if needed. 

* As a user I would like spinners to show that my payment is being processed.

* As a user I would appreciate tooltips to ensure I do not make mistakes when I make my booking.

* As a user I may make a mistake in my booking and I need a final check to ensure all details I have chosen are correct before making payment. 

* As a user I want to be able to use familiar chat messaging e.g. Facebook messaging. I can then check when the recipient last checked the messages and know when my message has been seen. I would prefer this to an unfamiliar chatbox not knowing if I am being responded to by a not or a real person. 

* As a user I may want to attend events mini festivals or intimate events to meet like minded people around a campfire or sharing circle.

* As a user I may want to attend events mini festivals or intimate events to improve my physical or mental health, walking, tai chi, stress relief, relaxation techniques.

* As a user I may want to attend events mini festivals or intimate events to learn a new skill, for example, yoga, foraging, meditation.

* As a user I may want to attend events mini festivals or intimate events to solve a problem, for example, I drink too much.

## Development planes to achieve objectives.

<hr>

### The strategy plane

Use agile design to lay out the foundations of booking system which is more attractive to users but satisfies the requirements of business users.
The strategy is to enable users to quickly find available camp spots that are free for the date they require within a searched for postal district or county.

Offer over night stays on camping sites, spots, independent small pitching places, farms, fields, land, gardens, driveways so take the uncertainlty out of raod trips

Once the available spots have been searched for and found in a selected location, the user can sort the options in to what is more important to them e.g price, category, 

The strategy is to fill up spots for the spot owners seamlessly and effortlessly. 
Most current system necessatate ringing round various sites and paying over the phone with a credit card. 
This is unreliable and unsecured. 

As the database fills with more campspots we will be able to offer extra filters.

We strategised to simplify the bookings, simplify  payment process, promote smaller independent sites and fill empty spaces on established sites.
Strategic aim would immediately attract the 12 % of users who do not book ahead and wait to judge the weather offer convenience and speed to the 88% of campers who want to book ahead. 

Still offer traditional phone and email booking so be useful and attractive by convention.

### The scope plane

The scope will be to attract users by offering simplicity and fast locating which sites are available with fast reliable payment.

The business user will be able to add their sites quickly and simply then turn the featuring on the site on and off with simple boolean checkbox.

### Structure

The site is structured to guide the user to book online which will be the preferred option for users and business users once they manage to adopt the process.
In the interim the structure does offer a less obvious traditional booking system by phone or email but the added option of FB messaging. 
Lazycamp considered that a chatbox but user feedback favoured the familiarity of social media as a mechanism for direct contact with the benefits of users knowing when the messages were last checked and managing expectations of when their queries will be answered also knowing who they are speaking to.
Chatboxes are a little impersonal and faceless for the travel industry which expects a more personal persuasive, friendlier touch.

### Skeleton plane

The home page uses design to direct the user to the online and payment booking system. 

#### Information Architecture 

The dropdown link and button options guide the user intuitively from the home page to the booking of campspots stored in the postgres database. The campspots held in the database will be the where all searches will lead to as this is the primary purpose of lazycamp. 

Products which are only available for local payment (not online) or change seasonally are stored separately in the data base. /n For the summer season this section will feature events. It is anticipated that this section will  include campsites who want to be featured but who do not want to have their payment made online. 

Two separate apps logically guide the user to either fast online booking options or traditional email/phone/messaging options. A distinction between the two is then obvious without any decsion making by the user. 

The information architecture is such that is minimises the amount of decisions a user needs to make before landing on the home page and checkout success. 

The information architecture is set out to enable a speedy conclusion of all user goals. 

All information that is expected to change including seasonnal products being promoted and contact method/ details have been separated in the code and the database so that the core of lazycamp is predictable for the user and familiarity allows users to find and refind what they want efficiently. 

Images are stored in AWS S3 bucket.


### Surface plane.

Appearance, images, colour choices and fonts were all chosen for modernity.

Different colours were tested in the logo design during development. User research resulted in the currently used logo being chosen. 

The bootstrap button and text colours which signify success, alert, warning, info and primary versus secondary actions/notification was adhered to. 
The colours were softened for the holiday rather than corporate feel. 

Modern design conventions were followed. 

The forms to complete were kept very simple. 
Focus to be kept on the information. 

The font chosen to be modern and easy to read. The logo uses a bespoke font with character, however, because the 'A' symbolised by a tent needs some interpretation the clarify of all the other letters was priority. 

Vibrant sourced images were mixed with original authentic images of actual camping trips in Wales and Scotland.

## Testing

Testing information can be found in separate ![test.md](/test.md) file

## Version Control with auto deploy to heroku. 

For version control Github has been used. Github is a distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) recommended by Code Institute which ensures we have a store of all significant changes made during development. Using Gitpod alongside Github had major advantages in terms of how easy it was to stage, write commit messages and push versions.

All significant version changes were pushed to github and automatically deployed to heroku once the app was connected to the github repository.

If a branch was for experimental work created the heroku auto deploy was deactivated in favour of manual deployment to check each time. 
Once the branches were merged the master auto deply was reinstated. 

Version control was used a working tool with return to code in previous version being common during development. Commit message were written to ensure changes were easy to find.

From the point at which gitpod pushed to github automatically then deployed to heroku, github version control and heroku build log mirrored each other perfectly. The following steps pushed all changed from gitpod to github then directly to heroku to be seen in the build log then in the browser using the heroku dashboard "open app" button.

### Gitpod and github/heroku commit/deploy

click on branch icon
Hover on changes and click + (plus) to stage changes
Type commit message
Hover on tick reveals commit tooltip. Click to commit.
Hover on more actions '...' click reveals dropdown with push option. Click on push.
Check that Build has succeeded in heroku dashboard. It may take a couple of minutes. Open app to check changes. Do not forget to refresh. Often F5 is needed to see the recent changes in the deployed app.

Branches were selected from the Gitpod terminal using :
git checkout -b new branch name

return to master branch:
git checkout master

Version control was relied upon throughout the development process. A number of times changes were aborted and an old version was reverted to. For example 


## Deployment

To deploy Lazycamp booking site to heroku, the following steps should be taken:

1. Create a requirements.txt file using the terminal command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt.

2. Create a Procfile with the terminal command echo web: python3 manage.py > Procfile.

3. git add and git commit the new requirements and Procfile and then git push the project to GitHub.

4. Create a new app on the Heroku website by clicking the "New" button in your dashboard. Give it a name and set the region to Europe. 

5. From the heroku dashboard of your newly created application, click on "Deploy" > "Deployment method" and select GitHub.

6. Confirm the linking of the heroku app to the correct GitHub repository.

7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on "Settings" > "Reveal Config Vars".

Set the following config vars:

Key	Value
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID	<your secret key>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY	<your secret key>
AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME	<your AWS S3 bucket name>
DATABASE_URL	<your postgres database url>
HOSTNAME	<your heroku app hostname>
SECRET_KEY	<your secret key>
STRIPE_CANCEL_URL	<link to all-products page in your app>
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE	<your secret key>
STRIPE_SECRET	<your secret key>
STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL	<link to checkout/confirm page in your app>

In your heroku dashboard, click "Deploy". Scroll down to "Manual Deploy", select the master branch then click "Deploy Branch".

Once the build is complete, click the "Open app" button provided.

From the link provided add /admin to the end of the url, log in with your superuser account 

Create instances within each model set up within the new database.

Once instances of these items exist in your database your heroku site will run as expected.

### Deployment using command line. 

npm install -g heroku

heroku login -i

git status

git add

git commit -m "initial commit"

git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/new-lazycamp

git push -u heroku master

git remote -v

pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

echo web: python app.py > Procfile

Initially I separately added to the github repository.

git add git commit -m "" git remote add (my repository named new-lazycamp) git push -u origin master

In the heroku dashboard, click "Deploy".

In the "Manual Deployment" section of this page, made sure the master branch is selected and then click "Deploy Branch".

The site is now successfully deployed.

Furthermore
From the command line of Gitpod:

Enter the heroku postgres shell
Migrate the database models
Create your superuser account in your new database
Instructions on how to do these steps can be found in the heroku devcenter documentation.


Environment variables, dependencies and any other differences between the dev and live versions.
The only difference is that the passwords and key values are stored in env.py for dev version (.gitignore file ensures passwords are not revealed on github). 
For the live version password and key values are stored and accessed in the heroku config vars.


### Running locally. 

From new-lazycamp Github repository I opened the gitpod workspace in gitpod.io. 
Python needed to be installed. 
The fastest way to load all the requirements is with the following command 
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt.

## Inspiration

I received inspiration for this project from X
In summer 2019, I drove to from Manchester in the UK to Mainland Greece then on to the Greek Islands. Booking camspites along the way was too difficult.
 One night my son and I were scaling a fence with our tents and sleeping bags.
Another night I accidently camped on a communal residential lawn which has once been a campsite but was then private property. I was woke up by an 
angry chalet owner insisting I was trespassing. +

Many people do not know how to prepare for a camping trip and so never experience the freedom it offers. Lazy camp will offer a set up ready to arrive with no kit and leave with your back back.

Late arrival is currently difficult. This will be one of the features on offer. 24/7 pitches will be available


The scottish 500 is an aspirational road trip with world class sunsets, wild beaches, cliffs, accessible islands with turquoise seas, mountains, culture, heritage, castles and legend. 
To prebook this is tricky and limits the enjoyment of the trip.
A last minute decision to divert or stay an extra night is bliss. lazy camp allows for this.
